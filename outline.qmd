## Introduction

- **Brief Overview**: Introduction to the session, highlighting the connection between data visualization, art, and computation.
- **Learning Objectives Recap**: Review the key learning objectives of CS 123.

## Section 1: Data Manipulation Refresher

- **Review of a Join Function**: Demonstrating how to merge datasets in R.
- **Bind Rows**: Combining multiple datasets.
- **Filter Function**: Extracting specific data based on conditions.
- **Group By and Summarize**: Aggregating data for meaningful insights.

## Section 2: Understanding ggplot and Layers

- **Introduction to ggplot**: Basic concepts and syntax.
- **Exploring Layers in ggplot**: How layers work to build a plot.

## Section 3: Working with Data Frames

- **Data Frame Structure**: Understanding rows and columns in the context of datasets.
- **Variables and Plot Types**: How variable types dictate the choice of plots.

## Section 4: Case Study - Music Data Analysis

- **Dataset Introduction**: Spotify data on The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Monkees.
- **Interactive Coding**: Participants modify code to explore different `ggplot` functions:
  - `geom_bar`
  - `geom_violin`
  - `geom_boxplot`
  - `geom_point`

## Section 5: Hands-on Exercise

- **Task**: Observers will engage in programming a simple plot.
- **Variables of Interest**: Number of Songs, Number of Albums, Valence, and Energy.
- **Objective**: Understanding the practical application of `ggplot` in visualizing data.

## Conclusion

- **Recap of Key Points**: Summarizing what was covered in the demonstration.
- **Q&A Session**: Open floor for questions and clarifications.
- **Connecting to Course Objectives**: Relating the demonstration back to CS 123's objectives of understanding computational art, teamwork, and developing a personal aesthetic in digital creations.
